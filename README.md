# RobustApiTemplate

This project is for me to test different techniques to use when building an API, to make it more robust and easier to support.

## Things I will be covering
- Endpoint versioning
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS
- Authentication
- Request size limits
- Rate-limiting (to prevent DDoS)
- Logging requests, responses, and exceptions
- Potentially replaying requests
- Thorough data validation and cleansing, with clear error responses
- Error-handling, with clear error responses
- Monitoring the service (including having a heartbeat endpoint)
- Sending out alerts
- Deployment/installation 
 
## Things I wonâ€™t be covering (for now) 
- Maxing out performance
- Caching
- Scaling
- Containerization
- Load-balancing
